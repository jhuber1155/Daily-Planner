# Daily-Planner

## Description

This daily planner was created as a way of helping people stay organized with their daily tasks and allows them to modify their day as they go about their busy days. Time management is a vital pillar to a successful career and work/life management. This project will hopefully allow people to gain some agency over where and how their day is spent as well as help them plan for small breaks or giant projects, as the situation dictates.

I learned quite a bit about while working on this project. I had a difficult time grasping how to traverse the DOM, but with the help of my instructors, I was able to understand how to grab elements from the HTML and manipulate them in the corresponding Javascript. I also reinforced my learning on how to create arrays with for loops and then navigate those for loops with the data located within them and then grab the appropriate values which I needed to make the planner change as time itself marched ever forward.

Another thing I learned was how I could effectively incorporate dayjs into a website and then manipulate my Javascript elements to display different data from the same continuous clock. 

Another new technique I learned was that of a string literal to help me pull the number I needed from a value and apply it to the #id I was trying to reference in HTML.
